## Weekly Study Schedule Template

**Beginner (20 hours/week):**
- Monday-Wednesday: Python/Math (2h/day)
- Thursday-Friday: ML theory (2h/day)
- Weekend: Projects (5h each day)

**Intermediate (15 hours/week):**
- Weekdays: Theory + coding (1.5h/day)
- Weekend: Project work (3-4h/day)

**Advanced (10 hours/week):**

## Getting Started Commands

```bash
# Browse all available agents
/browse-agent

# Take a knowledge assessment
/assess

# View complete roadmap
/roadmap

# Explore hands-on projects
/projects
```

## Next Steps

1. **Assess your current level** with `/assess`
2. **Choose learning path** based on results
3. **Start with relevant agent** (e.g., Programming Foundations)
4. **Build while learning** - theory + practice
5. **Track progress** weekly
6. **Adjust plan** as needed

**Remember:** Consistency beats intensity. Better to study 1 hour daily than 7 hours on Sunday!
